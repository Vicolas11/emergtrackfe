## About EmergTrack
EmergTrack is a cutting-edge web application that serves as an Emergency Traffic Intervention System, designed to address the critical challenges associated with emergency response and traffic management. Developed with React and TypeScript

## How it Works
A stranded User, potentially stuck in traffic, initiates the process by logging in and submitting an emergency request. The user provides details such as the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN), Plate Number, Car Colour, Car Brand, Car Location, and Additional Info for description. The request is received by the Admin, who then assigns a Rider and Driver to handle the User's request. Both the assigned Rider and Driver receive message notifications containing the User's vehicle details. Subsequently, they proceed to the location where the User's vehicle is located. The Rider transports the user on a motorcycle to the desired destination, while the Driver remains with the vehicle, moving it from the traffic to a designated office until the User comes to retrieve their vehicle.
